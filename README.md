# Bamboo Advertising Report
Analysis of advertising campaign to reassess where to allocate resources

## Summary
This report is comprised of two datasets, one is total sales and the other is a report from Amazon on the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The goal of this project is to summarize the two datasets and uncover any significant efficiencies/inefficiencies in order to optimize advertising spending in the future.

For the order report, I created several vizulaizations showcasing sales over time, how products are doing compared to each other and a geographical breakdown of where the bulk of sales are coming from.

For the advertising report, I focused more on trying to draw correlations between sales and the different metrics offered by Amazon.  

Moving forward, I will follow along as I receive new data to see how advertising efforts are effecting sales numbers.

## How to view project
* All cleaning was done in order report cleaning and ad report

* All vizualizations were done in Orders_Viz and Adverising_Viz

# Order Report
### Monthly Breakdown
* Looking at the monthly breakdown of sales we can see a steady increase in slaes over time with a steap increase in May and June
* IMPORTNAT NOTE, both December and June are only half of a month
* Looking forward I will be updating as time goes on to determine if these rises are seasonal or if they are going to continue to raapidly increase.

### Product Breakdown
* Here we can see that Rainforest Bowls are outperforming Floral Bowls every month.  
* The one unique trend is the dip in Rainforest sales in March along with a steep rise in Floral sales.  It could be worth looking into the following year to see if a simmilar trend takes place.

### Regional Breakdown
* Initially I wanted to see what states placed the most orders in order to hone in on what regional demographics are worth targeting.  However the first thing I noticed was that all of the states with high order totals all have massive population sizes.  
* This lead me to add a seconf vizualization to show which states have the most sales in relation to their population size.
* After viewing both graphs I'd conclude that California, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts and Colarado are the best states to market to.
